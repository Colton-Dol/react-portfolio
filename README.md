# React Portfolio

![Portfolio Page](/assets/portfolio.png)

## Description

This website hosts my coding portfolio to showcase prior projects I have worked on, both on my own and as a group. It also lists my proficiencies and has links to various social media platforms you can find me on.

## Installation

None required, simply head to the website [here](https://coltondolingportfolio.netlify.app/)!

## Usage

Use the navbar in the top right corner to go through the different pages. Click the icons on the bottom of each page to find me on the corresponding websites. You can click on the title of any project in the Portfolio page to be taken to the website, or the GitHub icon to be taken to the repository. The Contact page does not currently work, it will be up in the future though!
